**What are the main principles of OOP.**

- **Encapsulation** - implementation hiding.
- **Inheritance** - creating a new entity based on an existing one.
- **Polymorphism** - the ability to have different forms for the same entity.
- **Abstraction** - a set of common characteristics.
- **Sending messages** - a form of communication, interaction between entities.
- **Reuse** - everything listed above works for code reuse.

This is the only correct order of OOP paradigms, since each subsequent one uses the previous ones.
